	<p>Rock–paper–scissors is a zero-sum hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three 
	shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (✊ a simple fist), "paper" (✋ a flat hand), and "scissors" (✌️ a fist with the index and 
	middle fingers together forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another 
	player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors") but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to 
	a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. 
	Other names for the game in the English-speaking world include roshambo and other orderings of the three items, sometimes with "rock" being called "stone".</p>
